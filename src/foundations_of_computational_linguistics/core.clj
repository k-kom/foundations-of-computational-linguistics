;; * `strings` is like a sentence
;; * To characterize infinete languages, we can use 2 approaches: recognition and generation
;;   * recognizer: takes a string and returns a the string is in the language or not
;;   * generator: takes a number and returns a string which is in the language
;; * generator is nondeterministic
;;   * it takes an arugument `n` and generate a n-length string
;;   * and we don't know how the `n` was selected
;; * `flip` function defines a probability distribution
;;   * `flip` can be used as probability distribution to generator
;; * sampler uses generator and a probaility distribution to draw samples from a language, say (ab)*
;;   * sampler is _probabilistic generator_ (a probalistic version of the generator)
;; * we can also write the probabilistc equivalent to recognizer for a language: _scorer_
;; * recognizer and generator's probabilistic versions are scorer and sampler
;; * p (s) âˆˆ [0,1] and âˆ‘sâˆˆSp (s) =1
;;   * S is discrete probability distibutions as a set which is called the support, sample space or set ouf outcomes

;; memo
;; * a formal language is a _model_?
;;   * -> see 5. Formal Languages
;;   * we want to build up mathematically precise models to explain gramaticality
